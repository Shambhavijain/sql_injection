Vulnerable Voting App — SQL Injection Demonstration
❗Purpose
This project demonstrates how a voting application built with Python (Flask) can be vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks when user inputs are not properly sanitized.




🖼️ Architecture Overview
Below is the vulnerable architecture of the application:

Vote form input goes directly into unsafe SQL queries.

Attackers can manipulate the query, alter data, or bypass authentication.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Requirements: Python 3.x

1.Clone or download the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-app.git
cd voting-app


2.Install Flask if not already installed:

pip install flask


3.Initialize the database:

python init_db.py


4.Start the app:

python app.py
Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

🧪 SQL Injection Demo
Try submitting this as input in the voting form:

Candidate_id:
1', 1); UPDATE votes SET vote_count = 999 WHERE candidate_id = '1'; --

✅ This injects a malicious SQL command that sets the vote count to 999 for candidate ID 1.


Try submitting this as input in the result page:

🔓 Authentication Bypass Example
On a login or result page (if implemented), try this as username or query parameter:

' OR '1'='1
✅ This bypasses basic authentication or filters using always-true logic.

🧱 What's Vulnerable?
SQL queries built using string concatenation or f-strings.

No parameterized queries or input validation.

Direct execution of user input in SQL.

✅ How to Fix:
While this project shows how things can go wrong, here are best practices for securing it:

Use parameterized queries (e.g., cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM ... WHERE id = ?", (id,)))

Sanitize and validate all user inputs
