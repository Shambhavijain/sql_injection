# Vulnerable Voting App — SQL Injection Demonstration

##  Purpose

This project demonstrates how a simple voting application built with Python (Flask) can be vulnerable to **SQL Injection attacks** when user inputs are not properly sanitized or validated.  
The goal is to raise awareness about common web security flaws and emphasize the importance of **input validation** and **safe coding practices**.

##  Created By

**Shambhavi Jain**

This is the first project under **WatchGuard**, a company I founded to explore and showcase cybersecurity vulnerabilities in web applications.  
This demonstration project highlights the real-world risks of insecure coding practices by simulating a vulnerable voting system.

---

##  Architecture Overview

This is a deliberately insecure system that:

- Accepts vote form input and places it directly into unsafe SQL queries.
- Allows attackers to manipulate queries, alter database records, and even bypass authentication (if login is implemented insecurely).
- Lacks proper validation and uses raw string-based SQL queries.

##  Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python 3.x | Core programming language              |
| Flask      | Web framework used to build the app    |
| SQLite3    | Lightweight relational database        |
| HTML       | Used for building the frontend (forms) |

##  Setup Instructions

> **Requirements**: Python 3.x
```
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-app.git

2.cd voting-app

3.Install Flask if not already installed:

pip install flask

4.Initialize the database:

python init_db.py

5.Run the application:

python app.py

6.Open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## SQL Injection Demonstration
1. Vote Form Injection
Try submitting this as input for the Candidate ID field in the vote form:

   1',1); UPDATE votes SET vote_count = 999 WHERE candidate_id = '2'; --

2.  Result Bypass Injection

   'OR '1'='1

---

##  What's Vulnerable?
SQL queries built using string concatenation or f-strings.

No use of parameterized queries.

Lack of input sanitization and validation.

Use of executescript() that allows stacked SQL queries.

No use of secure authentication mechanisms (in insecure login scenarios).

---

##  Security Risks Explained
The app demonstrates how improper coding practices can lead to:

✅ Data tampering (e.g., modifying vote counts)

✅ Data leakage (e.g., exposing votes, users)

✅ Authentication bypass (e.g., logging in with ' OR '1'='1)

---

##  Future Improvements
🔐 Implement secure user authentication and session management with hashed passwords (e.g., using bcrypt).

🧼 Use security libraries to sanitize inputs.
